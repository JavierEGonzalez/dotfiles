ai_bash.sh user stories:

1. As a developer, I want to have a quick way to write a natural language requirement that will be executed in my shell.
1a. I should be able to simply type into my terminal and the output should be runnable on pressing enter.
1b. If the output is incorrect, I should be able to have these options:
  - Go into conversation mode in order to provide more context and get a corrected output.
  - Go into editor mode in order to manually edit the output before running it.
  - Go into doc mode with the target to learn and verify the command.
    - Going into doc mode should prefer man pages, then help pages, then online docs, and lastly asking a coding llm.
  - Exit without running anything.
1c. Have a redo command that will re-run the last command that was executed. Effectively go into last prompt.
